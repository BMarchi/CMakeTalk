# CMakeTalk

This repository contains a set of examples to understand how a basic part of CMake works. I decided to use the latest version of CMake at the moment of writing these examples just because I can.

## Requirements to run examples

* CMake 3.19.2

## How to run them

Every example can be run by just going to the build folder, and run in any terminal
`cmake ../
`cmake --build .`
